# Simulators for Boltzmann_BGK equation
 Contains two methods in standard Monte Carlo and Multilevel Monte Carlo versions
 
 kinetic_diffusion contains modules for the standard and multilevel Monte Carlo methods by Bert Mortier
 splitting contains modules for standard Monte Carlo method by Giovanne Samay and multilevel method by EMil Lovbak

 The methods are implemented in python using numba for optimization
